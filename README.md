# FineTune-Llama-2-with-QLoRA

## Steps

1. Create a custom dataset( I have used ChatGPT to create the custom dataset of poems )
2. As shown in the Jupyter Notebook "TinyPixel/Llama-2-7B-bf16-sharded" model was used to fine-tune
3. Kaggle platform was used for model training
4. After the model is fine-tuned it is saved and later used for inferencing( An example is shown at the bottom of the jupyter notebook)
